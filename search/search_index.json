Concepts such as escape velocity and cosmic velocities define the speed thresholds necessary for different types of motion \u2014 from stable orbiting to escaping a planet, or even a solar system entirely. These are not just theoretical physics concepts, but real-world tools used in designing missions, launching satellites, planning interplanetary trips, and one day \u2014 perhaps \u2014 achieving interstellar travel. \ud83c\udf0d Definitions of Cosmic Velocities In classical mechanics and astrodynamics, three main types of \"cosmic velocities\" are defined, each corresponding to a specific threshold in orbital mechanics: 1. \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) \u2013 Orbital Velocity Definition: The minimum horizontal velocity needed for an object to enter a stable circular orbit just above the surface of a celestial body (ignoring atmosphere).

The resulting path may be: A suborbital fall back to Earth, A stable circular or elliptical orbit , A parabolic path (exact escape), Or a hyperbolic trajectory (true escape from Earth's gravity). Understanding and predicting these trajectories is critical for: Designing satellite deployments, Planning reentry operations, Performing interplanetary injections. \ud83d\udcd0 Physical Background We assume that the only force acting on the payload is Earth's gravity , modeled by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation .
